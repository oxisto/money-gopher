# Contribution Guidelines

In general, I am looking forward for all kinds of contributions, especially in this early stage. However, contributions should promote and not conflict the core motivations about this project described [here](https://github.com/oxisto/money-gopher#why).

## Technology

So far, the only fixed piece is the use of Go in the backend and the use of some kind of RPC mechanism to provide a server. Code should follow the usual guidelines, such as [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go). All code is automatically built and and tested using GitHub Actions.
